What is the purpose of this project?

This project is focused on financial analysis, cost-saving identification, and revenue growth. It also incorporates newness by integrating advanced analytics, automation, and cutting-edge visualization techniques.


1. Data Layer:
- We're creating a synthetic data generator to simulate real financial data
- This approach gives us control over data patterns and helps avoid privacy issues
- The generated data will mimic real-world financial patterns including:
  - Seasonal revenue trends
  - Cost variations
  - Regional differences
  - Product-line performance

2. Analysis Layer:
